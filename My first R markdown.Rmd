## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
print("Hello world")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

```

This is how you would strike through some text:
~~strikethrough~~
```{r}

```
This is the format for including a link that appears as blue text in your markdown document:
[text that is shown](link.com)
```{r}

```
This is how do you produce bold text
**bold**
```{r}

```
This is how you produce italicized text
*some text*
